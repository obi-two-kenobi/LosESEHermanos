## Task overview 

### TASK 3
- [X] Specify at least 10 requirements 
- [X] Define the context / use cases of the system
- [X] Refine three use cases with activity diagrams
- [X] Based on this, define the analysis architecture (Context Diagram) with block diagrams (at least 10 blocks) and describe the main interaction with the environment with sequence diagrams

### TASK 4
- [X] Constraint the system with parametric constraint diagrams (at
least 5 constraints)
- [X] Allocate the diagrams to each other in an allocation diagram
- [X] Refine the architecture (block diagrams) with the help of internal
block diagrams (add at least 5 blocks)
- [X] Define the behavior with state machines of at least 3 components
- [X] Show / argument that the state machine behavior fulfills (refines) the interaction behavior (as modeled in the analysis phase)
- [X] Show partly the implementation level of one block including the state machine behavior
     - [X] Including the mapping to prototype Hardware (Arduino, Raspberry P, tinkercad) - Mapping should be done in a structured way ( Blocks, State machines, ...)
### TASK 5
#### SCHEDULING
- [X] Brake down the specified requirements to the level of scheduling
- [X] Define (test or analysis) the computation time (worst case) of the tasks of the component you implement
- [X] Use pyCPA (https://pycpa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) – if possible or calculate the wcet via knowledge of the hardware
- [X] Specify all scheduling constraints based on the requirements
- [X] Show that the implemented component with its set of tasks is scheduable (EDF or RMS or both).
#### V& V
##### INSPECTION
- [X] All team members have to do one inspection of a document
(Model, source code, ...) of an other team member
     -  E.g. Team member A developed the requirements and team member B inspects the requirements
- [ ] Documentation of inspection
          - Describe shortly the inspected document including the review
          - Positive and negative points
          -Negative points should have influence of an updated version of the document
##### TESTING

- [X] Define and execute 5 unit tests as validation tests  E.g. use the Junit or Cunit Framework
- [ ] Show the relation / trace to the requirements
- [X] Define at least 5 defect test
- [X] Define and execute 3 component / interface tests of the implemented block
- [X] Implement a component/block in a test driven based way
