## Task overview 

### TASK 3
- [X] Specify at least 10 requirements 
- [X] Define the context / use cases of the system
- [X] Refine three use cases with activity diagrams
- [X] Based on this, define the analysis architecture (Context Diagram) with block diagrams (at least 10 blocks) and describe the main interaction with the environment with sequence diagrams

### TASK 4
- [X] Constraint the system with parametric constraint diagrams (at
least 5 constraints)
- [X] Allocate the diagrams to each other in an allocation diagram
- [X] Refine the architecture (block diagrams) with the help of internal
block diagrams (add at least 5 blocks)
- [] Define the behavior with state machines of at least 3 components
- [] Show / argument that the state machine behavior fulfills (refines) the interaction behavior (as modeled in the analysis phase)
- [] Show partly the implementation level of one block including the state machine behavior
     - [] Including the mapping to prototype Hardware (Arduino, Raspberry P, tinkercad) - Mapping should be done in a structured way ( Blocks, State machines, ...)
